# Sorting Algorithms (In Progress)

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithms** repository! 👨‍💻👩‍💻

This repository is **under development** and is being used as a learning tool for implementing different sorting algorithms in Python. As we continue to explore and understand various sorting methods, more algorithms will be added.

## 📂 Algorithms Currently Being Implemented

Here are the sorting algorithms that are being learned and implemented so far:

1. **Insertion Sort**  
   This algorithm picks each element and inserts it into the correct position within the already sorted part of the list.

2. **Selection Sort**  
   This method works by selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and placing it in the sorted portion.

More sorting methods will be added as we progress through the learning process.

Stay tuned as we continue to improve and expand this repository! 🚀
